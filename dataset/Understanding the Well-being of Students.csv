even in university, class , clubs .. It seems like people are not interested in talking to me, as they're usually with others
It leaves me with a sense of isolation and disconnection in those situations
I find myself listening to their conversations and laughter, but the feeling of not being part of it eventually leads me to leave 
Even when I try to talk, no one listens That's why I feel invisible",No,3,2,No,No,"I find my academic performance challenging due to the demanding schedule, which includes charged courses throughout 6 days a week, including Wednesday afternoons
don't get much time to rest, and there's a lot of stuff to study in a short time and a lot of projects

Minimize scheduled study time",2,4,"Having more help for stress and time management. Workshops and talks about these things would be useful
Having a private place to talk about problems and more counseling options would also be good to support students during tough times
Making sure students know about these services is important too
I suggest creating a mobile platform or app free for students to talk and have consultations with psychologists
Personally, I can't afford to see a psychologist, and even the university psychologist isn't available
I suggest organizing university hikes",I look forward to bringing back the psychologist to our university
